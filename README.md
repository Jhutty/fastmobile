# FastMobile

Welcome to FastMobile!

FastMobile is a new next-generation mobile app framework for fast, scalable native mobile applications with minimal, compact code. It’s designed to be:

- Powerful and expressive enough to build the most advanced, interactive native mobile apps you can imagine.
- Fast and lightweight, so you can write less code and get more done.
- Easy to learn and use, with a simple, intuitive syntax that makes it easy to build complex apps quickly.

FastMobile apps are just Python code, so you can use FastMobile with the full power of the Python language and ecosystem. FastMobile’s functionality maps 1:1 directly to Hyperview XML, but allows them to be encapsulated using good software engineering practices—so you’ll need to understand these foundations to use this library fully. 

FastMobile builds on top of FastHTML (https://fastht.ml/). To understand how and why this works, please read this first: LINK!!!
